## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - For the backend

### What I learned

I learned a lot in this challenge, especially about managing state in React applications and how to handle user interactions effectively. I also improved my skills in using CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design.

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving. I also want to explore more advanced CSS techniques for styling and layout, and to find a way to make the code more modular and reusable.

Also, I would like to improve my code in the future so it is more clean and simple.
